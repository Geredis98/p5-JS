DESCRIPTION
-----------
This repository containts a simple JavaScript project of a Cross & Noughts game. Players makes their turns by clicking on a gameboard. I have also created a small sysmtem to evaluate whether a winning condition (putting five of the same symbol in the same row, column or diagonal) is reached.

Features added:
- Two-player mode (one for X and one for O)
- System for recognizing winning condition

Future goals:
- Simple AI system for evaluating turns
- Simple UI with score a statistics
