DESCRIPTION:
------------
This repository constains my small project in p5 JS. It is supposed to be a simulator of gravity force. User is able to create a planet with a random diameter to a canvas. The higher the delimeter is the more gravity force the object produces. Planets are reacting to each other in the form of lowering the distance between each other until the inevitable merging of the planets.
Each planet has a random color. The color of a planet created by merging two existing planets is selected by combinating their RGB. 

Future goals:
- set a name to each planet
- adjust size and shape of a planet
