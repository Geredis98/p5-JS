DESCRIPTION:
------------
This repository constains my small project in p5 JS. It is supposed to be a simulator of gravity force. User is able to create a planet with a random diameter on a canvas. The higher the delimeter is the more gravity force the object produces. Planets are reacting to each other in the form of lowering the distance between each other until the inevitable merging of the planets.
Each planet has a random color. The color of a planet created by merging two existing planets is selected by combinating their RGB.

TO-DO List:
- [x] Create a planet object
- [x] Simulate gravitational constant
- [x] Set random color to every generated planet
- [] Create custom shaped planets
- [] Create the option to name the planets
- [] Adjust the speed at which planets move
